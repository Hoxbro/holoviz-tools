# Information

Tools I use for the development of the different Holoviz repos. They are made available here in case they are useful to others, but no support is provided.

`$HOLOVIZ_DEV` is the path to the directory where you have development files. Could be a synchronized folder like Dropbox or Google Drive.

`$HOLOVIZ_REP` is the path to the directory where you have cloned the different repos.

I use the following function in my `.zshrc` file: `holoviz() {source "$HOME/Repos/holoviz-tools/holoviz.sh"}`

`$GITHUB_TOKEN` is the token you get from GitHub to access the API. You can get one from your GitHub account settings [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).
