# Information

Tools I use for the development of the different Holoviz repos. They are made available here in case they are useful to others, but no support is provided.

`$HOLOVIZ_DEV` is the path to the directory where you have development files. Could be a synchronized folder like Dropbox or Google Drive.

`$HOLOVIZ_REP` is the path to the directory where you have cloned the different repos.

I use the following alias in my `.zshrc` file: `alias holoviz='source $HOME/Repos/holoviz-tools/holoviz.sh'`
